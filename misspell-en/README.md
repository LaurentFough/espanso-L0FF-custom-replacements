# misspell-en

misspell-en is a espanso package which is replacing commonly misspelled english words.
The package is based on [github.com/client9/misspell](https://github.com/client9/misspell).

Currently the package is not working accurate since something like an
**abbreviation mode** is missing in espanso. For further details take a look
at issue [#82](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/issues/82).

## Installation

Install the package with:

```
espanso install misspell-en
espanso restart
