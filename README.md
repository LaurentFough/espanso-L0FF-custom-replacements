# espanso-misspell-en

`espanso-misspell-en` is holding [espanso](https://espanso.org) packages which
are replacing commonly misspelled english words.

The packages are auto-generated based on word lists from
[github.com/client9/misspell](https://github.com/client9/misspell).

At the moment the packages are not working accurate since something like an
**abbreviation mode** is missing in espanso. For further details take a look
at issue [#82](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/issues/82).
